## Project Management:

Project Identification:
- Projects are driven by business needs

Business Value:
- Tangible Value  
	- Can be quantified and measured directly  
	- Example: 2 percent reduction in operating costs  
- Intangible Value  
	- We know it will add value & save time, but we may not be able to quantify or measure its benefits  
	- Example: improved customer service

The System Request:
- A document that describes the reasons for and the value added from building a new system
- Contains 5 elements:
	- Project sponsor: the primary point of contact for the project  
	- Business need: the reason prompting the project  
	- Business requirements: what the system will do  
	- Business value: how will the organization benefit from the project  
	- Special issues: Anything else that should be considered

Feasibility Analysis:
- Is this project feasible?  
	- What are the risks?  
	- Can these risks be overcome?  
- Major components:  
	- Technical feasibility (Can we build it?)  
	- Economic feasibility (Should we build it?)  
	- Organizational feasibility (Will they use it?)

Technical Feasibility:
- Identify risks in the following areas:  
	- The functional area: Are analysts familiar with this portion of the business?  
	- The technology: Less familiarity generates more risk  
	- Project size: Large projects have more risk  
	- Compatibility: Difficult integration increases the risk

Economic Feasibility (Cost-Benefit Analysis):
- Identify the costs vs. benefits  
- Assign values to the costs and benefits  
- Determine the cash flow  
- Determine the value using one or more methods:  
	- Net present value (NPV)  
	- Return on investment (ROI)  
	- Break-even point

Organizational Feasibility:
- Will the users accept the system?  
- Is the project strategically aligned with the business?  
- Conduct a stakeholder analysis  
	- Project champion(s)  
	- Organizational management  
	- System users  
	- Others

Project Selection:
- Projects are approved, declined or delayed based on value added vs. risks  
- Project portfolio management  
	- Goals:  
		- Maximize cost/benefit ratio  
		- Maintain an optimal mix of projects based on:  
			- Risk  
			- Size, cost & length of time to complete  
			- Purpose, scope & business value  
	- Limited resources require trade-offs  
- Selected projects enter the project management process
